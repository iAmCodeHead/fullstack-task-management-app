The frontend is built with reack and TypeScript. Notable libraries used include but not limited to:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/)
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Features
- **User Authtentication**
- **User Authourization**
- **Creating of task**
- **Fetching all tasks**
- **Fetching single task**
- **Editing a task**
- **Deleting tasks**
- **Statistics of completed tasks**
- **State Management**

## Improvements
If given more time, a few things ccould have ben improved, namely:
- A better error handling mechanism
- A more intuitive empty state and data validation mechanism
- Improved state management
- Writing of unit tests
- Pagination is tasks
- More atomic components
- Secure User logout


## Backend

 This work sample comes with many built-in features, such as request validation, unit and integration tests, docker support, API documentation, pagination, etc. For more details, check the ```features``` section below.

This project opted for yarn over npm as a package manager because Yarn is known for being faster than npm in terms of package installation and overall performance. This is because Yarn uses a caching mechanism to store packages on the local disk, which speeds up the installation process. [see more](https://www.copycat.dev/blog/yarn-vs-npm/). (Disclaimer: This is only a matter of personal preference).

```bash
yarn dev
```

Add your changes to TypeScript(.ts) files which are in the src folder. The files will be automatically compiled to JS if you are in watch mode.

Add tests for the new feature

Run `yarn test:ts` to make sure all Typescript tests pass.

```bash
yarn test:ts
```

## Environment Variables

The environment variables can be found and modified in the `.env` file. They come with these default values:

```bash
# Port number
PORT=3000

# URL of the Mongo DB
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/your_database_name
```

## API Documentation

To view the list of available APIs and their specifications, run the server and go to `http://localhost:3000/v1/docs` in your browser. This documentation page is automatically generated using the [swagger](https://swagger.io/) definitions written as comments in the route files.

### API Endpoints

List of available routes:

**User routes**:\
`POST /v1/users` - create a user\
`GET /v1/users` - get all users\
`GET /v1/users?sortBy=created:desc` - get all users in descending order by ```created``` field\
`GET /v1/users?sortBy=created:asc` - get all users in ascending order by ```created``` field

## Error Handling

The app has a centralized error handling mechanism.

Controllers should try to catch the errors and forward them to the error handling middleware (by calling `next(error)`).

```typescript
  try {
    const user = await userService.createUser(req.body);
    res.status(httpStatus.CREATED).send(user);
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
```

The error handling middleware sends an error response, which has the following format:

```json
{
  "code": 404,
  "message": "Not found"
}
```

When running in development mode, the error response also contains the error stack.

The app has a utility ApiError class to which you can attach a response code and a message, and then throw it.

For example, if you are trying to get a user from the DB who is not found, and you want to send a 404 error, the code should look something like:

```typescript
import httpStatus from 'http-status';
import ApiError from '../errors/ApiError';
import User from './user.model';

const getUser = async (userId) => {
  const user = await User.findById(userId);
  if (!user) {
    throw new ApiError(httpStatus.NOT_FOUND, 'User not found');
  }
};
```

## Validation

Request data is validated using [Joi](https://joi.dev/). Check the [documentation](https://joi.dev/api/) for more details on how to write Joi validation schemas.

The validation schemas are defined in the `src/validations` directory and are used in the routes by providing them as parameters to the `validate` middleware.

```typescript
import express, { Router } from 'express';
import { userController, userValidation } from '../../modules/user';
import validate from '../../modules/validate/validate.middleware';

const router = express.Router();

router
  .route('/')
  .post(validate(userValidation.createUser), userController.createUser)
  .get(validate(userValidation.getUsers), userController.getUsers);
```

## Logging

Import the logger from `src/modules/logger/logger`. It is using the [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) logging library.

Logging should be done according to the following severity levels (ascending order from most important to least important):

```typescript
import logger from './src/modules/logger/logger';

logger.error('message'); // level 0
logger.warn('message'); // level 1
logger.info('message'); // level 2
logger.http('message'); // level 3
logger.verbose('message'); // level 4
logger.debug('message'); // level 5
```

In development mode, log messages of all severity levels will be printed to the console.

In production mode, only `info`, `warn`, and `error` logs will be printed to the console.\
It is up to the server (or process manager) to actually read them from the console and store them in log files.\

Note: API request information (request url, response code, timestamp, etc.) are also automatically logged (using [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)).

## Custom Mongoose Plugins

The app also contains 2 custom mongoose plugins that you can attach to any mongoose model schema. You can find the plugins in `src/models/plugins`.

```typescript
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import toJSON from '../toJSON/toJSON';
import paginate from '../paginate/paginate';

const userSchema = mongoose.Schema(
  {
    /* schema definition here */
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

userSchema.plugin(toJSON);
userSchema.plugin(paginate);

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

### toJSON

The toJSON plugin applies the following changes in the toJSON transform call:

- removes \_\_v, createdAt, updatedAt, and any schema path that has private: true
- replaces \_id with id

### paginate

The paginate plugin adds the `paginate` static method to the mongoose schema.

Adding this plugin to the `User` model schema will allow you to do the following:

```typescript
const queryUsers = async (filter, options) => {
  const users = await User.paginate(filter, options);
  return users;
};
```

The `filter` param is a regular mongo filter.

The `options` param can have the following (optional) fields:

```typescript
const options = {
  sortBy: 'name:desc', // sort order
  limit: 5, // maximum results per page
  page: 2, // page number
};
```
The `paginate` method returns a Promise, which fulfills with an object having the following properties:

```json
{
  "results": [],
  "page": 2,
  "limit": 5,
  "totalPages": 10,
  "totalResults": 48
}
```

## Linting

Linting is done using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io).

In this work sample, ESLint is configured to follow the [Airbnb JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base) with some modifications. It also extends [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) to turn off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier.

To modify the ESLint configuration, update the `.eslintrc.json` file. To modify the Prettier configuration, update the `.prettierrc.json` file.

To prevent a certain file or directory from being linted, add it to `.eslintignore` and `.prettierignore`.

To maintain a consistent coding style across different IDEs, the project contains `.editorconfig`
